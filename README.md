## Security Best Practices

This project implements comprehensive security measures:

### Authentication Security
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Leaked Password Protection**: Should be enabled in Lovable Cloud backend settings

### Database Security
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: All tables have proper RLS policies
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin roles managed through `user_roles` table
- **Comment Ownership**: Users can only delete their own comments; admins can moderate all

### Input Sanitization
- All user-generated content is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Character limits enforced on all text inputs
- Special characters escaped in HTML output

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts are logged
- Suspicious activity patterns are detected
- Security events are tracked in the `logs` table

### First Admin Setup
1. Sign up for an account through `/auth`
2. Open the Lovable Cloud backend panel
3. Navigate to Auth → Users and copy your user ID
4. Go to Database → Tables → `user_roles`
5. Insert a new row:
   - `user_id`: [your user ID]
   - `role`: admin
6. Refresh the page

### Enabling Leaked Password Protection
1. Open Lovable Cloud backend
2. Navigate to Authentication → Policies
3. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
4. This prevents users from using commonly leaked passwords

### Security Monitoring
The project includes a `security-monitor` edge function that:
- Logs authentication failures
- Detects potential brute force attacks (>5 failed attempts in 5 minutes)
- Monitors comment spam (>5 comments per minute)
- Tracks admin actions for audit trails

All security events are logged to the `logs` table with `scope: 'security'` for easy monitoring.
